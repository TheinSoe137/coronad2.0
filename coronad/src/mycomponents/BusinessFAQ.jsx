     Coronad Comic Business FAQ</h1>
      <Accordion title="What is the Coronad Comic Business?">
        Coronad is building a new model for comic publishing—one that combines traditional storytelling with digital ownership and community-driven narrative evolution. Our comics live inside the Coroverse, an expanding universe where storylines are shaped by NFT traits, relics, and character arcs.

      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="What makes Coronad’s comics unique?">
       • NFT-Integrated Storytelling: Characters, traits, and items from our NFT collections directly influence the comic narrative.<br/>
 • Living Universe: Stories are released in chapters that evolve based on events and holder interactions.<br/>
 •  Airdrop Utility: Special comic tie-in NFTs offer narrative upgrades, new powers, and exclusive access to side stories or limited arcs.

      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title=" How does Coronad generate revenue through comics?">
       • Digital Sales: Comic issues may be released digitally as NFTs or sold via Web3-native comic platforms.<br/>
 • Print Publishing (Future Plan): Select arcs and rare issues will be turned into physical comics.<br/>
 • Merch & Licensing: Characters and stories are designed to expand into merchandise and external IP licensing.<br/>
      
       We are open to onboarding guest artists, writers, and co-creators from the Web3 and indie publishing space.</Accordion>

      <Accordion title=" How do NFTs affect the comics?">
      • PFP Traits = Comic Identity: If your character has a relic or rare symbol, it might appear in key comic panels.<br/>
 •  Airdrops = Plot Devices: Special NFTs unlock exclusive stories or change narrative outcomes.<br/>
 •  Holder Influence: Certain holders will get voting rights or narrative shaping power over future arcs.
      </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="  Can I publish with Coronad Comics?">
      Eventually, yes. We plan to open creator submission programs for artists, writers, and community members to pitch short stories or arcs based in the Coroverse. These can be:<br/>

 • Canon (approved by the lore team).<br/>
 • Non-canon/side stories (labeled as "Legends").<br/>
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Is Coronad Comics for just Web3 readers? ">
      No. While our stories are born in Web3, our vision is to reach:<br/>

 • Traditional comic fans via print or Web2 platforms.<br/>
 • Digital-native readers via collectible comic NFTs.<br/>
 • Web3 communities who want ownership, involvement, and unique narrative experiences.<br/>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="How can holders benefit from Coronad Comics? ">
      • Exclusive Access: Certain comics will only be available to holders.<br/>
 • Character Cameos: PFPs with special traits might appear in story arcs.<br/>
 •  Permanent Upgrades: Comic NFTs and airdrops enhance the narrative value of your main NFTs.<br/>
 •  Creator Credit: Long-term holders may even co-create or be credited in the comic lore.
      </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often are comics released? ">
      We aim for chapter-based releases:<br/>

 • Short-form comics: Monthly (starting post-launch).<br/>
 •  Full arcs/volumes: Every 2–3 months.<br/>
 • Special editions or crossover arcs will be tied to airdrops or seasonal drops.
