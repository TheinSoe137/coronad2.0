The Coronad Roadmap Begins

The Coroverse is awakening.
Phase 1 is already in motion — building the foundation of a universe where NFTs don’t just look good, they *live, breathe,* and reshape the story.

A PFP collection like no other is coming, tied directly to our original comic world. Your traits will *matter.* Your NFTs will evolve.

Airdrops? Exclusive powers? Narrative influence?
Yes. And that’s just the beginning.

We’re not just launching art —
We’re launching a universe.

Mainnet is coming.
Only the crowned will rise.

Coronad Comic Business FAQ

1. What is the Coronad Comic Business?

Coronad is building a new model for comic publishing—one that combines traditional storytelling with digital ownership and community-driven narrative evolution. Our comics live inside the Coroverse, an expanding universe where storylines are shaped by NFT traits, relics, and character arcs.


2. What makes Coronad’s comics unique?

 • NFT-Integrated Storytelling: Characters, traits, and items from our NFT collections directly influence the comic narrative.
 • Living Universe: Stories are released in chapters that evolve based on events and holder interactions.
 •  Airdrop Utility: Special comic tie-in NFTs offer narrative upgrades, new powers, and exclusive access to side stories or limited arcs.


3. How does Coronad generate revenue through comics?

 • Digital Sales: Comic issues may be released digitally as NFTs or sold via Web3-native comic platforms.
 • Print Publishing (Future Plan): Select arcs and rare issues will be turned into physical comics.
 • Merch & Licensing: Characters and stories are designed to expand into merchandise and external IP licensing.


4. Who creates the comics?

The Coronad team leads the core development. This includes:

 • Writers crafting long-form arcs tied to the NFT world.
 • Artists developing visual narratives (collabs are welcomed).
 • Lore Architects ensuring trait/story consistency across chapters.

We are open to onboarding guest artists, writers, and co-creators from the Web3 and indie publishing space.


5. How do NFTs affect the comics?

 • PFP Traits = Comic Identity: If your character has a relic or rare symbol, it might appear in key comic panels.
 •  Airdrops = Plot Devices: Special NFTs unlock exclusive stories or change narrative outcomes.
 •  Holder Influence: Certain holders will get voting rights or narrative shaping power over future arcs.


6. Can I publish with Coronad Comics?

Eventually, yes. We plan to open creator submission programs for artists, writers, and community members to pitch short stories or arcs based in the Coroverse. These can be:

 • Canon (approved by the lore team).
 • Non-canon/side stories (labeled as "Legends").


7. Is Coronad Comics for just Web3 readers?

No. While our stories are born in Web3, our vision is to reach:

 • Traditional comic fans via print or Web2 platforms.
 • Digital-native readers via collectible comic NFTs.
 • Web3 communities who want ownership, involvement, and unique narrative experiences.


8. How can holders benefit from Coronad Comics?

 • Exclusive Access: Certain comics will only be available to holders.
 • Character Cameos: PFPs with special traits might appear in story arcs.
 •  Permanent Upgrades: Comic NFTs and airdrops enhance the narrative value of your main NFTs.
 •  Creator Credit: Long-term holders may even co-create or be credited in the comic lore.

9. How often are comics released?
We aim for chapter-based releases:

 • Short-form comics: Monthly (starting post-launch).
 •  Full arcs/volumes: Every 2–3 months.
 • Special editions or crossover arcs will be tied to airdrops or seasonal drops.
